# Haliax
Haliax is my personal python library built around a pure c++ libary `lanre`. 

## Installation
clone or download this repo and run
```bash
pip install .
```

## Requirements
The core c++ libary requires the [`Eigen`](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and [`boost`](https://www.boost.org) to be installed.

## Features

### `dm_models`
`Haliax` has a set of dark matter models for which I've used in my research. It contains:
- `constant_thermal_cross_section`
- `kinetic_mixing`
- `higgs_portal`
- `darksun`
- `dipole_dm`
